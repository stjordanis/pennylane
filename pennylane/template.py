QML Templates
=============

**Module name:** :mod:`pennylane.template`

.. currentmodule:: pennylane.template

This module provides a growing library of templates of common quantum
machine learning circuit architectures that can be used to easily build,
evaluate, and train more complex quantum machine learning models.


.. note::

    The templates below are constructed out of **structured combinations**
    of the :mod:`quantum operations <pennylane.ops>` provided by PennyLane.

    As a result, you should follow all the rules of quantum operations
    when you use templates. For example **template functions can only be
    used within a valid** :mod:`pennylane.qnode`.


Examples
--------


For example, you can construct a circuit-centric quantum
classifier with the architecture from :cite:`schuld2018circuit` on an arbitrary
number of wires and with an arbitrary number of blocks by using the
template :class:`StronglyEntanglingCircuit` in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    from pennylane.template import StronglyEntanglingCircuit
    from pennylane import numpy as np

    num_wires = 4
    num_blocks = 3
    dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=num_wires)

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(weights, x=None):
        qml.BasisState(x, wires=range(num_wires))
        StronglyEntanglingCircuit(weights, periodic=True, wires=range(num_wires))
        return qml.expval.PauliZ(0)

    weights = np.random.randn(num_blocks, num_wires, 3)
    print(circuit(weights, x=np.array(np.random.randint(0, 1, num_wires))))


The handy :func:`Interferometer` function can be used to construct arbitrary
interferometers in terms of elementary :class:`~.Beamsplitter` operations,
by providing lists of transmittivity and phase angles. PennyLane can
then be used to easily differentiate and optimize these
parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    from pennylane.template import Interferometer
    from pennylane import numpy as np

    num_wires = 4
    dev = qml.device('default.gaussian', wires=num_wires)
    num_params = int(num_wires*(num_wires-1)/2)

    # initial parameters
    r = np.random.rand(num_wires, 2)
    theta = np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi, num_params)
    phi = np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi, num_params)

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(theta, phi):
        for w in range(num_wires):
            qml.Squeezing(r[w][0], r[w][1], wires=w)

        Interferometer(theta=theta, phi=phi, wires=range(num_wires))
        return [qml.expval.MeanPhoton(wires=w) for w in range(num_wires)]

    print(qml.jacobian(circuit, 0)(theta, phi))

The function :func:`CVNeuralNet` implements the continuous-variable neural network architecture
from :cite:`killoran2018continuous`. Provided with a suitable array of weights, such neural
networks can be easily constructed and trained with PennyLane.

def Interferometer(theta, phi, varphi, wires=None, mesh='rectangular', beamsplitter='pennylane'):
    r"""pennylane.template.Interferometer(theta, phi, varphi, wires)
    General linear interferometer.

    For :math:`N` wires, the general interferometer is specified by
    providing :math:`N(N-1)` transmittivity angles :math:`\theta` and the same number of
    phase angles :math:`\phi`, as well as either :math:`N-1` or :math:`N` additional rotation
    parameters :math:`\varphi`.

    For the parametrization of a universal interferometer
    :math:`N-1` such rotation parameters are sufficient. If :math:`N` rotation
    parameters are given, the interferometer is over parametrized, but the resulting
    circuit is more symmetric, which can be advantageous.

    By specifying the keyword argument ``mesh``, the scheme used to implement the interferometer
    may be adjusted:

    * ``mesh='rectangular'`` (default): uses the scheme described in
      :cite:`clements2016optimal`, resulting in a *rectangular* array of
      :math:`N(N-1)/2` beamsplitters arranged in :math:`N` layers and numbered from left
      to right and top to bottom in each layer. The first beamsplitter acts on
      wires :math:`0` and :math:`1`.

      .. figure:: ../_static/clements.png
          :align: center
          :width: 30%
          :target: javascript:void(0);

      :html:`<br>`

    * ``mesh='triangular'``: uses the scheme described in :cite:`reck1994experimental`,
      resulting in a *triangular* array of :math:`N(N-1)/2` beamsplitters arranged in
      :math:`2N-3` layers and numbered from left to right and top to bottom. The
      first and forth beamsplitters act on wires :math:`N-1` and :math:`N`, the second
      on :math:`N-2` and :math:`N-1`, and the third on :math:`N-3` and :math:`N-2`, and
      so on.

      .. figure:: ../_static/reck.png
          :align: center
          :width: 30%
          :target: javascript:void(0);

    In both schemes, the network of :class:`~.Beamsplitter` operations is followed by
    :math:`N` (or :math:`N-1`) local :class:`Rotation` Operations. In the latter case, the
    rotation on the last wire is left out.

    The rectangular decomposition is generally advantageous, as it has a lower
    circuit depth (:math:`N` vs :math:`2N-3`) and optical depth than the triangular
    decomposition, resulting in reduced optical loss.

    .. note::

        The decomposition as formulated in :cite:`clements2016optimal` uses a different
        convention for a beamsplitter :math:`T(\theta, \phi)` than PennyLane, namely:

        .. math:: T(\theta, \phi) = BS(\theta, 0) R(\phi)

        For the universality of the decomposition, the used convention is irrelevant, but
        for a given set of angles the resulting interferometers will be different.

        If an interferometer consistent with the convention from :cite:`clements2016optimal`
        is needed, the optional keyword argument ``beamsplitter='clements'`` can be specified. This
        will result in each :class:`~.Beamsplitter` being preceded by a :class:`Rotation` and
        thus increase the number of elementary operations in the circuit.

    Args:
        theta (array): length :math:`N(N-1)/2` array of transmittivity angles :math:`\theta`
        phi (array): length :math:`N(N-1)/2` array of phase angles :math:`\phi`
